This is the workflow for resources.

This is a directory based workflow to enable people to edit these in
multiple geographic locations.  (If files are moved using "git mv" then the
history goes with the files)

Files *must* be moved using "git mv".  This allows moves to be pushed
enabling "claiming for editting" (avoiding duplicated effort) and also
retaining of history.

Directories:
    * WIP - Chunk of files that are a WIP - generally speaking each editor
      should have their own WIP directory.  (A WIP directory means you're
      spending less time worrying about which files you're working on, and
      also allows users to "claim" files when working on them)

    * 0.tostart - Files that have not been started

    * 1.question_outlines - Files that have the core questions written -
      these effectively form a syllabus.

    * 2.outline_answers - Files that have sufficient answers to the
      questions.  This is a first draft.  The important thing at this stage
      is "are the answers right"

    * 3.rearranged_answers - Files containing the answers, that have been
      rearranged into a better order improving the "flow" of the resource.

    * 4.language_simplified - Files that have had their language simplified. 
      These should be checked using FOG index and fleisch-kincaid reading
      age scores.  The files should ideally be at the age range of no older
      than 11/12

At all points in time:
    * Consider creating concept files
    * Consider - should I split this document in two?

Once documents enter the language_simpified stage, they can be copied into
the resources directory.

The workflow for concepts is different for the simple reason that they're
there primarily for dependency provision, and so for authors not for
learners.

As they are completed, once dropped into resources/concepts you can test
them by running als.py in this directory
