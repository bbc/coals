To Authors:

Create a directory in here with your initials on.

When you claim a file or files for working on (since they may make sense to
work on together), move them into your directory.  This prevents duplication
of effort.  (But doesn't preclude you working together)

When happy, move the completed files into the right locations in the workflow.
