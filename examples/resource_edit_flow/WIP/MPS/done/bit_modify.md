WHO WHAT WHY WHERE WHEN HOW

WHO
    User who wants to modify how their bit works.

WHAT
 What must the learner understand prior to this resource?
    How to use their microbit 
    What the microbit is (this is implied from above)

 What must the learner understand at the end of this resource?
    They should know where to find the editors
    They should know how to either find or enter a pre-existing piece of
    code and how to modify it
    They should understand that this gives them a hex file.
    They should understand how to get this onto their device.
    Since this is an intro, we'll just get them to change "Hello" to their
    name or similar.
    There should ideally be 2-3 changes done - so that there's a progression
      * A number. (say in a countdown)
      * A string.
       - The user does not need to know it's a string at this point.
       - Indeed the user does not need to know the difference between things
         but does need to know that a number must be in digits, not in
         words.
      * A sequence of instructions.

    This might actually be a progression of examples to work through, and
    these will logically split *LATER* into a collection of smaller
    resources. For now assume this is one resource.


HOW
  What is the relevant "How" question for this resource. Answer it.
  (Probably tells them "how to do this thing")
    How does the user find the editors they want?
    How does the user choose the editor they need?
    How do they modify the code to get it to do something?
    How do they get the resulting hex file from that program
    How do they run a similation? (can they - depends on language)
    How to they run their program on their device.

WHY 
  Why do they need to know this ?
    They need to know this in order to start writing their own programs.
    Before they can do that they need to understand how to change programs.

  What is the learner able to do at the end of this resource?
    The user is able to modify a program with some level of confidence.

  Why does this matter to then?
    Unless they have some experience of tinkering with working code, they
    have very little chance of making their own working code.  Knowing they
    are starting from something that is known to work is an important step
    in creating their own work.

WHERE
 HERE: Why do they need to know this ?
    The examples being changed should ideally be embedded in this resource.

 THERE: Where can they find more information?
    There can be links to more resources and more examples going through
    these questions differently. (eg using different media)

WHEN
  When will they find this useful ?
    Immediately after loading an example they may well want to change things
    to work their way. So this will be pretty immediate.

* Write the questions for this resource.                 --> QUESTION OUTLINES WRITTEN
* Write answers for the questions.                       --> ANSWER OUTLINES WRITTEN
* Arranges the answers into a useful interesting order   --> ANSWERS REARRANGED
* Simplify the langange                                 --> LANGUAGE SIMPLIFIED
* CONCEPTS ARISING
