WHO WHAT WHY WHERE WHEN HOW

WHO
    The reader of this page is a child, who has a microbit of their own

WHAT

 What must the learner understand prior to this resource?
    The reader is assumed to already have a microbit, but that they know
    nothing about it.

 What must the learner understand at the end of this resource?
    They should understand:
       * That the microbit is a small programmable device.
       * That it has a number of inputs, outputs, and a processor
         We can summarise what these are, but save detail until "use"
       * That there is a way of getting programs onto the device.
       * That there is a way of creating their own programs for the device.
       * That it is designed to enable them to get started on a journey but
         be useful/fun in its own right
       * That it can be used and embedded in other creations of their own.
       * That the most important thing is that it is theirs to play and
         experiment with, so that can use it their way as they see fit.

HOW
 What is the relevant "How" question for this resource. Answer it.
 (Probably tells them "how to do this thing")
    There isn't really a specific how here. The only specific how here is
    for them to understand it is theirs. The how here might more relate to
    how to write the text for this. It might be better to use pictures, or
    video or some alternative media.

    An important detail is to give explicit permission to the reader to play
    with the device as it suits them.

WHY 
  Why do they need to know this ?
    They need to know this because otherwise they won't know what the device
    is or that it's targetted at them.

  What is the learner able to do at the end of this resource?
    Have the confidence to move on to the next stage where they start using
    their bit and exploring what to do with it.

  Why does this matter to then?
    So that they can use it.

WHERE
 HERE:
    In this tutorial we should answer all of these core questions.

 THERE: Where can they find more information?
    There could be more links to the microbit website about the microbit
    Pages targetted at children
    Pages targetted at teachers

WHEN
 When will they find this useful ?
    This information is mainly useful to the child when they first get their
    microbit
