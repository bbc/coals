WHO WHAT WHY WHERE WHEN HOW

WHO
 Who needs to know this?
    The person who has a microbit

WHAT
 What must the learner understand prior to this resource?

    They must understand what the microbit is, what it can do, that they can
    change what it does, where the website is, and where to get more
    information.

 What must the learner understand at the end of this resource?
    How to use their microbit specifically:
      * What batteries used to power the microbit.
      * How to plug in the battery pack
      * How to use the device (factory hex file)
      * How to plug in the USB cable to their computer
      * How to get the hex file onto their device
      * Where to get more hex files and/or
      * Where to get/make an example hex file? (less likely)

HOW
    How do they power the microbit?
      (batteries -- AAA, USB - leave croc clips for later)
    How do they put the batteries in?
    How do they plug the battery pack in?
    How do they use the device when that's the case?
    How do you plug in the USB cable?
    Grab this hex file
    How do you get a hex file onto your computer? (These are logically
    different resources...)
      * Linux
      * Raspberry Pi
      * Windows
      * Mac OS X
    What is the relevant "How" question for this resource. Answer it.
    (Probably tells them "how to do this thing")

    There should be 2 hexfiles to support this:
        * An example "dice"  hexfile - so that the microbit can be useful in
          other things immediately
        * The factory reset hex file - which resets the microbit to factory
          defaults.

WHY 
 Why do they need to know this ?
    The user needs to know this because they cannot actually use their
    device without knowing this.

 What is the learner able to do at the end of this resource?
    The learner will be able to power their devices, fiddle with it, and get
    new hex files onto the device.

 Why does this matter to then?
    They need to know how to use the device before they can change what the
    device does.

WHERE
 HERE: What example can we give the user?
    This is less of an example, but more example of how to do things.
    There should be the two hex files here:
       * The "dice" example
       * The factory reset example

 THERE: Where can they find more information?
    Links would be useful.


WHEN
 When will they find this useful ?
    This contains information useful upfront.
    Ongoing:
      * Batteries they can use
      * USB cable
      * Connecting & disconnecting battery pack
      * How to load a hex file.
