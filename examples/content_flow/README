This is the core of set of resources for the resource_edit_flow to target.

As resources come out of the resource_edit_flow the following things should
happen:

   * The resources get copied into the resources directory
   * The concept files get copied into the concepts directory

To run this you must have installed the libraries.

To run this (sanity check really) you do this:

   $ als.py 

This runs the core engine over the system.
